Hi, I'm **[Anish](https://anishwantstobeasecurity.engineer/images/FBF78BCC-9599-4726-9770-1FB9AEFE7394.png)** and I have some weird obsession with **Security**, **Startups** and ~~Cycling~~ **Sycling**.

## Security,

As a Security Researcher/Bug Bounty Hunter I have ~~hacked~~ secured many companies and Acknowledgements from these make me the most proud,
